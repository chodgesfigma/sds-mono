# SDS Dev Resources (REST)

- `npm run script:dev-resources` (REST API only)
- Sets dev resources for all components described in [scripts/dev-resources/devResources.mjs](./scripts/dev-resources/devResources.mjs) to match.
- Useful when swapping urls in bulk. Requires `Dev Resources: Write` scope on your REST API token.
