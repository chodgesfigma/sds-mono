      <sds-text>Simple Design System (SDS) is a base design system that shows how
        Figma's Variables, Styles, Components, and Code Connect can be
        used alongside a React and CSS codebase to form a complete picture
        of a responsive web design system.</sds-text>

      <sds-text>SDS is not just another design system. There are still many gaps
        between design and development, and SDS provides some best
        practices for how to bridge them. SDS attempts to remain honest
        about its implications in code, while also offering
        customizability in design beyond a simple theming layer that is
        typical of many code-first component libraries.</sds-text>

      <sds-text>Whether you're looking to use SDS to start a new project, or are
        looking for examples of some common design systems best practices,
        you'll find tools inside this codebase and Figma file to steer you
        in the right direction.</sds-text>
